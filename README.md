# Zenburn for OS X Terminal

This is an adaptation of Jani Nurminen’s [Zenburn] color scheme for the Terminal application built into OS X.

## Installation

Just double-click the “Zenburn.terminal” file. This will add Zenburn to the list of terminal profiles in Preferences&nbsp;→ Settings. (It will also open a new window that uses these settings.)

### Caveat

Each “terminal profile” includes not just color settings but also a bevy of other settings—font, window position, window title, etc. To minimize this annoyance I started with the “Basic” profile and changed just the colors in order to make Zenburn.terminal. You may still wish to change the other options to suit your preferences.

### Compatibility

The Zenburn.terminal file was created under OS X 10.9 (Mavericks). I assume (but have not verified) that it will also work under 10.10 (Yosemite). I don’t know whether it will work on earlier versions.
